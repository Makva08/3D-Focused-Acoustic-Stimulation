This repository is created for developing a novel chip-scale focused ultrasound device called 3D-FAST (3D Focused Acoustic STimulation) for non-invasive neuromodulation with precise temporal and spatial control. 
The technology aims to overcome current limitations of neural stimulation techniques by offering micron-scale resolution and 3D beam-steering capabilities. 
It will be based on Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) due to its optical transparency and superior acoustic properties, integrating Fresnel lenses with phase control circuitry for dynamic steering.
Masons Model will be developed to have Impedance matching between layers, to avoid undesirable reflections.
The study involves the design, fabrication, and characterization of the 3D-FAST device, as well as functional mapping of neural circuit responses using electrophysiology and imaging. 
Ultimately, the research seeks to provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation and advance therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders and pain management.
