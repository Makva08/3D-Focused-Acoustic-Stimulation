This repository is created for developing a novel chip-scale focused ultrasound device called 3D-FAST (3D Focused Acoustic STimulation) for non-invasive neuromodulation with precise temporal and spatial control. 
The technology aims to overcome current limitations of neural stimulation techniques by offering micron-scale resolution and 3D beam-steering capabilities. 
It will be based on Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) due to its optical transparency and superior acoustic properties, integrating Fresnel lenses with phase control circuitry for dynamic steering.
Masons Model will be developed to have Impedance matching between layers, to avoid undesirable reflections.
The study involves the design, fabrication, and characterization of the 3D-FAST device, as well as functional mapping of neural circuit responses using electrophysiology and imaging. 
Ultimately, the research seeks to provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation and advance therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders and pain management.


Stack consists of:
Silicon Wafer Substrate (500um);
Lithium Niobate (50um): The primary piezoelectric material, selected for its high optical transparency (>80%), strong piezoelectric electromechanical coupling (kt ~47%), and high acoustic wave velocity (~7340 m/s).
LN is bonded to a 500 Âµm thick silicon (Si) wafer substrate through ion-slicing technology.
LN substrate was wet-etched (TMAH) to achieve 50um thick membrane.

Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) Electrodes: Transparent electrodes patterned on both the top and bottom surfaces of the LN membrane (Patterning enables phase control and dynamic steering of the ultrasound focal spot). Concentric rings and segmented arc designs in ITO electrodes provide axial and full 3D beam steering.

Parylene Layer: Forms the Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP) on top of the LN transducer. Encapsulates air cavities created through lithography and a sacrificial photoresist layer. Air cavities enable constructive interference of the ultrasound waves, focusing them with high precision.

Aluminum (Al) Routing and Gold (Au) Pads: Used for electrical connections and CMOS integration.
